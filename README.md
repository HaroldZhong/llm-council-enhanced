## 🎯 Key Features

### ✨ Phase 1: Advanced RAG System (NEW - Dec 2025)
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: BM25 (keyword) + Dense (semantic) search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Query Rewriting**: Automatic coreference resolution for natural follow-up questions
- **Confidence Scoring**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW trust indicators based on council consensus
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Topic extraction and quality metrics for every conversation turn

### Core Council Process
- **Stage 1 (Collect)**: Multiple LLMs provide independent responses to your question
- **Stage 2 (Rank)**: Council members evaluate and rank each other's answers anonymously
- **Stage 3 (Synthesize)**: Chairman LLM creates final answer based on rankings and deliberation

### Additional Features
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Context-aware dialogue with RAG-powered memory
- **Chain of Thought**: See reasoning steps from models that support it
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time usage and cost analytics per conversation
- **Model Selection**: Choose your council members and chairman dynamically
- **File Upload**: Process PDFs, images, and text files with AI analysis
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Usage statistics, model performance, and cost breakdowns

## 📖 How It Works

### The 3-Stage Council Process

When you ask a question in **Council Mode**:

1. **Stage 1: Independent Responses**
   - 5+ council models each provide their own answer
   - No knowledge of what others are saying
   - Responses shown side-by-side for comparison

2. **Stage 2: Anonymous Ranking**
   - Each model ranks ALL responses (including their own)
   - Responses are anonymized during ranking
   - Creates aggregate rankings showing consensus

3. **Stage 3: Final Synthesis**
   - Chairman model reviews all responses and rankings
   - Creates authoritative final answer
   - **NEW**: Includes confidence score (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

### Advanced RAG Architecture

**Before Phase 1:**
- Simple dense-only retrieval
- No query preprocessing
- Basic metadata

**After Phase 1:**
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines BM25 (keyword matching) + Dense (semantic understanding)
- **Query Rewriting**: Resolves pronouns like "it", "its", "that" in follow-ups
- **Rich Metadata**: Topics, quality scores, consensus metrics for every turn
- **Confidence Scoring**: Trust indicators based on model agreement

**Example:**
```
You: "Explain RAG systems"
Council: [Detailed explanation with HIGH confidence]

You: "What are its limitations?"
↓ Rewritten to: "What are the limitations of RAG systems?"
↓ Hybrid search finds relevant context
↓ Chairman answers using retrieved context
```

---

## 📊 Phase 1 RAG Features

### 1. Query Rewriting
Automatically expands abbreviated follow-up questions:
- **Original**: "What about its limitations?"
- **Rewritten**: "What are the limitations of RAG systems?"
- **Config**: `ENABLE_QUERY_REWRITE = True` in `backend/config.py`

### 2. Hybrid Retrieval
Combines keyword and semantic search:
- **BM25**: Exact keyword matching (e.g., "BM25", "ChromaDB")
- **Dense**: Semantic similarity (understands concepts)
- **Fusion**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion merges results
- **Filtering**: Conversation-scoped to prevent cross-talk

### 3. Confidence Scoring
Trust indicators based on council agreement:
- **HIGH** (>0.75): Strong consensus, factual questions
- **MEDIUM** (>0.5): Some disagreement, nuanced topics  
- **LOW** (≤0.5): Significant disagreement, subjective questions

### 4. Enhanced Metadata
Every council turn stores:
- **Topics**: Extracted keywords (e.g., "RAG", "ChromaDB")
- **Quality Metrics**: Per-model average rank and consensus score
- **Timestamps**: For temporal queries and analysis

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...  # Required
```

### Model Configuration (backend/config.py)
```python
# Council members (5-7 recommended)
COUNCIL_MODELS = [
    "openai/gpt-5.1",
    "google/gemini-3-pro-preview",
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    # ... add more
]

# Chairman (usually most capable model)
CHAIRMAN_MODEL = "google/gemini-2.5-pro"

# Phase 1 features
ENABLE_QUERY_REWRITE = True  # Enable/disable query rewriting
```

### RAG Tuning (backend/rag.py, backend/hybrid_retrieval.py)
```python
# Retrieval settings
RAG_MAX_TOKENS = 3000        # Max context size
threshold = 0.01             # RRF score threshold

# Hybrid weights
bm25_weight = 0.5           # Keyword importance
dense_weight = 0.5          # Semantic importance
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Council Mode (Full Deliberation)
Best for: Complex questions, important decisions, diverse perspectives
```
Ask: "Should I use microservices or monolithic architecture?"
→ 5 models debate
→ See rankings and reasoning
→ Get synthesized answer with MEDIUM confidence
```

### Chat Mode (Quick Responses)
Best for: Follow-ups, clarifications, quick answers
```
Ask: "What did you say about databases?"
→ Query rewritten automatically
→ Retrieves relevant past context
→ Quick answer from Chairman
```

## 📈 Analytics

Access the analytics dashboard to view:
- **Total Conversations**: Count and cost
- **Model Usage**: Which models are used most
- **Average Costs**: Per conversation and per model
- **Confidence Distribution**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW breakdown

## 💰 Cost Governance (NEW - Dec 2025)

### Session Budget
Set a spending limit per conversation:
- **Presets**: $1 / $2 / $5 / No Limit
- **Warnings**: Inline alerts at 70%, 85%, 100% of budget
- **Graceful degradation**: No hard stops, just reduced context

### Automatic Budget-Aware Routing
The system automatically adjusts based on your budget status:

| Spent | RAG Context | Mode |
|-------|-------------|------|
| ≤70% | Auto (from task) | From task signal |
| 70-85% | Medium (8k) | Standard |
| 85-100% | Low (4k) | Quick |
| >100% | Low (minimal) | Quick |

### Task Awareness
Query analysis detects intent:
- **Quick**: Short queries, "briefly", "quick"
- **Research**: Long queries, "cite", "compare", "analyze"
- **Standard**: Default balanced mode

### Quality Floor
Budget constraints never break the experience:
- Always responds (no "budget exceeded" errors)
- Always includes ≥1 RAG chunk when available

### Configuration (backend/config.py)
```python
RAG_SETTINGS = {
    "presets": {
        "low": {"tokens": 4000},
        "medium": {"tokens": 8000},
        "high": {"tokens": 16000},
    },
    "absolute_max_tokens": 32000,
}

SESSION_POLICY_DEFAULTS = {
    "budget_usd": None,  # None = no limit
    "notify_thresholds": [0.70, 0.85, 1.00],
}
```
